# Pok√©mon Availability - Client
A frontend client of a two part app for checking Pok√©mon availability given a selection of games. 

This project is written in ReactJS. Parts of the code were generated using [DeepSeek-R1](https://chat.deepseek.com/) and the [Cline](https://cline.bot/) extension with [Claude 3.5-Sonnet](https://claude.ai/) in Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

## üéâ The app is live! ü•≥
That's right, this app is finally live! The client is on Netlify, and the server is on Render.com!

**[See it live](https://pokemon-checker.netlify.app/)**! Please make use of it as much as you like. 

> There is a limitation of the server being hosted on Render.com: it will spin down during periods of inactivity, so after pressing **Find Pok√©mon** you may not see your results at that moment, but the request will usually be sent. \
> You may try again after a minute or so, and you should have your results. If not, or if you find any novel error, you may submit an issue here on GitHub, or send me an email [here](mailto:vh48@pm.me).

### Server
You may find the Server repository [here](https://github.com/VHCosta/pokemon-availability-server).


## Known bugs/issues/things to improve

* Missing availability data for all Switch games. This data is unavailable in PokeAPI.
* Filtering Slot 2 data is currently handled in the frontend rendering logic with some if-statements. Toggling Gen 3 games on/off allows you to see this behavior in realtime. For example, if Caterpie is available in Pearl with FireRed in Slot 2, you should see "Slot 2 (FireRed)" when both FireRed and Pearl are selected. This verification should be moved to the backend, unless enough interest in the current functionality is voiced.

## Future Plans:

* Include an option to find Unavailable Pokemon, basically "inverting" the output.
